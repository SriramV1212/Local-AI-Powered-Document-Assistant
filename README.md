Welcome to the **Local AI-Powered Document Assistant** project! This tool is designed to process and analyze unstructured documents locally using **DeepSeek 8B** (via Ollama) and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. It aims to provide **semantic search**, **summarization**, and **question-answering** capabilities while ensuring **privacy** and **offline functionality**.

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to create a **local AI-powered assistant** that can:
- Process and analyze unstructured documents (PDFs, text files, etc.).
- Enable **semantic search** and **summarization** using a vector database (**FAISS**) and **LangChain**.
- Provide a **user-friendly web interface** (built with **Streamlit**) for uploading documents, asking questions, and viewing results—all running **offline** for enhanced privacy and security.

---

## 🛠️ **Current Progress**

- **DeepSeek 8B** installed locally using **Ollama** on macOS.
- Virtual environment set up for the project.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Integrate **FAISS** for vector storage and retrieval.
  - Implement **LangChain** for RAG-based document processing.
  - Build the **Streamlit web interface** for user interaction.

---

## 🧩 **Tech Stack**

- **AI Model**: DeepSeek 8B (via Ollama)
- **Frameworks**: LangChain, FAISS
- **Web Interface**: Streamlit
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Environment**: Virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`)
